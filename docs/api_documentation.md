# Task Management API Documentation

## Overview

The Task Management API is a simple RESTful service built with Go and Gin for managing tasks. It allows users to create, retrieve, update, and delete tasks.

## Features
- Add new tasks
- View all tasks or a specific task by ID
- Update existing tasks
- Delete tasks

## How to Use
1. **Run the API locally** using Go. The server will start on `http://localhost:8080/` by default.
2. **Import the Postman Collection** using the link below to easily test all endpoints without manually crafting requests.
3. **Explore and interact** with the API using Postman. The collection includes all available endpoints and example requests.

**Postman Collection:** [Task Management API Postman Collection](https://web.postman.co/workspace/ed1fcb1b-aa6d-4608-8bfc-abf010bb0f11/collection/40582744-b2fb455a-9a0a-4cc8-a97e-4e19c73def65?action=share&source=copy-link&creator=40582744)

## This Project 
- Implements of a RESTful API using Go and the Gin web framework.
- Used in-memory storage for tasks (for demo).
- Provided full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for tasks.
- Documented and tested all endpoints using Postman, making it easy for users to try out the API.

## Getting Started
- Clone the repository and run the server with Go.
- Use the Postman collection to send requests and see responses instantly.
